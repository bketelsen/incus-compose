## incus-compose completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(incus-compose completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	incus-compose completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_incus-compose"

#### macOS:

	incus-compose completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_incus-compose

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
incus-compose completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --cwd string   change working directory
      --dry-run      print commands that would be executed without running them
  -d, --verbose      verbose logging
```
